                      <h2 class="">Madeline</h2>
                      <p>Madeline is a 1939 book written and illustrated by Ludwig Bemelmans, the first in the book series of eleven books, which inspired the Madeline media franchise. It is considered one of the major classics of children's literature through the age range of 3 to 8 years old.

                        Madeline was named a Caldecott Honor Book for 1940 and a subsequent book in the Madeline series, Madeline's Rescue, earned a Caldecott Medal in 1954. This book was also a New York Times Outstanding Book of the Year and an ALA Notable Children's Book.</p>

                  <h2 class="">Characters</h2>
                   <p><b>Madeline</b>, also known by her full name Madeline Fogg, is the main protagonist and title character of the Madeline series.<br>
                    Throughout most of her childhood, Madeline has attended the boarding school in Paris, France under the care of Miss Clavel. She made a major impression on the other girls through her imagination and bravery.</p>
                    <p><b> Clavel</b>, better known by her nickname Miss Clavel, is the deuteragonist of Ludwig Bemelmans' Madeline books.
                      She is a nurse (though in some adaptations she is explicitly referred to as a nun) and a teacher teaching in the boarding school simply known as "The Old House in Paris".
                     <br>
                     Miss Clavel has light skin and short, brown, wavy hair. She wears a nun-like attire with a dark blue nun's headdress, a blue dress, a dark blue cape, and black shoes. 
                    <br>
                    Miss Clavel is known to be wise, caring, loving, and motherly, especially towards Madeline. She usually teaches the girls various moral lessons to solve their daily conflicts for them to gain better insights in reality. She can be seen teaching the girls science, math, literature, music and arts, sometimes even physical education.

                      <p><b>Nicole</b> is one of the twelve little girls, being very close to Madeline, along with Genevieve, Chloe and Danielle.
                        Nicole is a girl with black eyes and short dirty-blonde hair ending beneath her ears.
                        Nicole is known as a "late bloomer" due to struggling with reading and her studies. She is very sweet and innocent, but can be naive at times as a result.
                        <br>
                        <b>Danielle</b> is also one of the Twelve little girls. Out of all of them, she is close with Madeline.
                        Danielle is a girl with fair nose skin, and a fluffy, thick dark brown hair that lightened over the course of the series.
                        Danielle is a worry-wart over things and when stressed out or concerned, she is likely to start crying. Danielle is Lawful Good in alignment.
                        <br>
                        <b>Chloe</b> is one of the Twelve little girls and is considered second-in-command of the group, replacing Madeline if she isn't around.
                        Chloe is a French girl with long, carrot-orange (later on appearing dull orange-brown) hair. On one of her dolls, her hair is a dark auburn.
                        Chloe takes on the role of a big sister, and cares deeply for Madeline. She is thoughtful towards her needs and often worries over her. Like Madeline, she also possesses good detective skills and can be a leader in times of need.
                        <br>
                        <b>Pepito</b> is arguably the best supporting character  and Madeline's next-door neighbor. He is Spanish and has three cousins. He wears a distinctive hat called the “bad hat”.
                        He has dark hair, and often wears a red shirt with white sleeves.Pepito was Neutral Evil in his debut.
